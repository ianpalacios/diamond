## Maven Instructions

1. mvn clean install

2. mvn exec:java

## New Feature

3/13/18 - Update made to handle out of bounds conditions. 
Now the program displays points that go out of bounds on the other side of the array for a "wrapping" effect.

## Coming Soon:

1. Variable Input Parameters

	The program runs a fixed set of hard coded parameters.
	Instead collect the following from the user on the prompt:
	* Array Dimensions (rows/cols)
	* Starting Point (row/col)
	* Threshold (n)

2. HTML View

	Build the output in HTML without changing the program if possible.
